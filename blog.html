            <p>Website went online. Probably best to have something to keep a record of all my interests and endeavours in one spot. Creating a website from scratch seemed alot more fun than using something like Google Sites. Thanks to Zeul for helping me set it up. :)</p>

            <p>I want to talk about my time when I lived in Calgary, and specifically shine a light on the Tsuut'ina Nation. The Tsuut’ina reserve borders the city of Calgary in the southwest and I would often drive past it when travelling to the city's southeast. I feel that I passed this reserve as I did so in my mind, I didn’t show any curiosity to what went on within or wondered about the history of the reserve and the Tsuut’ina Nation. With a new perspective gained from learning about the impact of colonization and contemporary issues, I will talk about the Tsuut’ina Nation’s history, specifically about the legacy of colonization that was left. </p>

            <p>The story of the creation of the nation stems from a migration towards southern Alberta with a quite tragic background. During their migration south, the ancestors encountered a frozen lake with thin ice which they had to cross quickly. While being carried by their mother, a child wanted their mother to pick up an object that was sticking out of the ice for a toy. The mother reluctantly started to chip away at the ice to retrieve the object for her child. It turned out that the object was a horn of a dragon (Taslani) which became angered and split the ice, killing many and separating the people. The Tsuut’ina were the people who continued south, while the Dene returned to the north <a href="https://tsuutina.com/our-history/">[1]</a>.</p>

            <p>I recently had a look at the Google news tab when I searched Tsuut’ina, and I found a recent story about a Calgarian man being attacked with a hammer in the reserve <a href="https://calgary.citynews.ca/2024/02/01/calgary-man-tsuutina-attack/">[2]</a>. Another news story was about human remains being found near the Tsuut’ina reserve <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10403601/rcmp-investigate-discovery-of-human-remains-near-tsuutina-nation/">[3]</a>. The headline of the human remains story failed to include the details of the fire that was the cause of this death. The article also states that the police are treating this case as a homicide. Bad news always stirs a stronger reaction from the consumer over good news, and the way the Tsuut’ina nation is being depicted in these examples would likely lead people to prematurely believe that the reserve is dangerous and is best avoided.</p>

            <p>Like all Indigenous people in Canada, the Tsuut’ina nation has had its experience dealing with oppression and the impact of colonialism. An example of this occurred in 1885, two years after the establishment of the Tsuut’ina Nation’s reserve, the Canadian government established a pass system to control as what the pass system described as “rebellious Natives” for all Indigenous people. This pass system criminalized Indigenous people if they did not present proper travel passes to leave their land for trade or other purposes. This pass system was put into place in response to the 1885 Northwest Resistance led by Louis Riel <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/pass-system-in-canada">[4]</a>. It was believed by the settler government that a pass system would prevent another rebellion by restricting travel. The pass system was in effect for over 60 years, and it was finally abolished in 1951 <a href="https://tsuutina.com/our-history/">[1]</a>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Just like how the Northwest Rebellion took place, the people of the Tsuut’ina Nation also made a clear effort to resist colonialism. In 1904, Chief Bullhead rejected a land surrender stating that they did not intend to sell or give up any part of their reserve <a href="https://tsuutina.com/our-history/">[1]</a>. Unfortunately, after Chief Bullhead’s passing, land was surrendered in 1914. A major act of resistance to Canadian law displayed by the Tsuut’ina Nation was the rejection of Bill C-31 which adopted their own Citizenship Code. The Tsuut’ina Nation was only one of two reserves that declined the adaptation of Bill C-31 <a href="https://tsuutina.com/our-history/">[1]</a>. This is significant because it shows the Tsuut’ina Nation’s ability to self-govern and resist policy procured by non-Indigenous people.</p>

            <p>I wrote this entry to my blog to look back at a time when I was ignorant and to fill in missing pieces of knowledge. Learning is a non-linear lifelong commitment. You will reflect on events in life and try to make things right and further your understanding of your past to live in a better-informed future. Not only do I want to encourage readers to keep in mind the lands, histories, and cultures of Indigenous people in Canada while on their paths of learning, but I want everyone to acknowledge the opportunity to learn about the legacy of colonialism in Canada to understand and act on global issues surrounding the oppression and colonization of Indigenous people everywhere. The average person in powerful nations is silent, complacent, and selfish. The liberation of people around the world requires a strong and unified effort to combat global systems of oppression. Do your part and fight for a future of harmony.</p>

            <p>I Just bought the Bambu Labs A1. Super excited to test it out and have the ability to work on personal projects faster with better quality. My Ender 3 has served me well for the last year and couple of months, I think its definitely time for an upgrade.</p>
