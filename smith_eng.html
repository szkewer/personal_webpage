                <p>Our third-year design course revolved around designing and implementing a shiftable gearbox to be used in a speed and hill climb competition at the end of the semester. This semester-long project also involved the implementation of theory from lectures. We were required to be familiar with the terminology for gears and how changing different gear specifications affected performance. In our group of six, I ran simple simulations in Python to determine our optimal gear ratios for speed and torque. I was responsible for assembling the gearbox, minimizing friction between parts, and ensuring the shifting mechanism functioned as intended. Our group successfully implemented the gearbox into a prebuilt RC car with a drive train. We placed 5th overall out of about 40 groups for the speed race and an unknown ranking for the hill climb event.</p>
